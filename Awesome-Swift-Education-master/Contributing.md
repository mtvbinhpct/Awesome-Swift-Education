## **Contributing Guidelines**
Let this list serve as a huge thank you to the incredible Swift Community. It would not exist if the people behind Swift were not so incredibly innovative, intellectual, and enthusiastic about the language and about open source. I created this list because I believe that the Swift community can be just as smart as the Haskell Community if guided properly. If you would like to make the Swift community smarter and contribute to this list, make sure to check out the emoji key and please open up a pull request or send a tweet of the content to [@CantBeMoreWrong](https://twitter.com/CantBeMoreWrong). If the topic of the content is already exists on the list, create an adjacent emoji to the existing content. I realize that this list is by no means perfect, so if you have an idea as to how I can change it, please let me know!
